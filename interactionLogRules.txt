Whenever making a new route in index.js to handle your Axios requests from the client side, be sure to include a bodyParams object in the format below with the correct information substitude for the values...

For example, if posting a new Review, your bodyParams in the specific route in server/index.js should look something like this:

app.post('/SOME ROUTE THAT INDICATES WHAT YOUR REQUEST IS', (req, res) => {
  let bodyParams = {
    'element': 'NAME OF ELEMENT WHERE THE CALL FOR A REVIEW TO BE ADDED ORIGINATES',
    'widget': 'NAME OF YOUR PARTICULAR MODULE',
    'time': new Date()
  }
  model.getAllProducts(req, res, bodyParams)
})

make sure you pass bodyParams to your model.METHOD which is setup to handle the necessary API interaction.

Continuing the example, here is what that might look like in model/index.js:

const addOneReview = (req, res, bodyParams) => {
  axios.get(apiURL + '/whateverReviewAPI', {headers: {'Authorization': APIKEY.APIKEY}})
  .then((APIRes) => {
    res.send(APIRes.data)
    logInteraction(bodyParams) <-- THIS MUST HAPPEN!
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    res.status(400).send(err)
  })
}


and that is it! you should see a log in your server console that says the interaction was sucessfully logged.
